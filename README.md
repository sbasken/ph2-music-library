Description: This is a music library single page application built with react.js using the create-react-app. 

As a user, I can:
1. Sort and filter through a song library through a search function by several different criteria (ex: album, title, artist, genre). 
2. Look through the song library and find more details about songs by clicking on them. 
3. Add more songs to the page and they will persist via our JSON server. 
4. Edit details of the songs that will be stored on the server. 
5. Delete the songs.
